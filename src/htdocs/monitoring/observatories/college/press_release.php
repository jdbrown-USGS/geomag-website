	Press Release

	<p>
		Research site renamed in honor of longtime geophysicist<br/>
		<br/>
		For Immediate Release<br/>
		July 20, 2009
		<br/><br/>
		FAIRBANKS, Alaska‹The University of Alaska Fairbanks has renamed a 46-acre
		research site in honor of its visionary and developer, Jack Townshend. The
		Jack Townshend College International Geophysical Observatory is a network of
		eight state-of-the-art facilities that collect geomagnetic, seismic and
		geophysical data to support research at the Geophysical Institute, the
		International Arctic Research Center, the U.S. Geological Survey, as well as
		other national and international organizations. The site is situated
		northwest of Smith Lake behind the UAF campus.
	</p>
	<p>
		Townshend, 82, is a long-time USGS geophysicist that has worked with the
		university research community for 46 years. He designed and developed CIGO,
		a project that took 10 years to complete, with encouragement from GI
		Director Roger Smith and Syun-Ichi Akasofu, former director of both the GI
		and IARC. 
	</p>
	<p>
		³Jack Townshend is a world leader as a creator of excellent observatories,²
		Roger Smith said. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The research site was completed in 1996. It is one of five scientific
		observatories Townshend has helped develop across the globe during his
		career that spans more than six-and-a-half decades.
	</p>
	<p>
		The renaming of the CIGO site is the third honor Townshend has received from
		UAF. In 1995 Townshend received an honorary doctorate of science from the
		university. Four years later an area of campus was renamed Townshend Point.
		Today, the site is marked by a large boulder and bronze plaque and is
		located at the crest of College Hill, near the University of Alaska Museum
		of the North.
	</p>
	<p>
		Jack Townshend was appointed as the special projects coordinator for the
		USGS Geomagnetism Program in Golden, CO. and principal consultant and
		advisor of CIGO in 2002. He continues to serve in those positions today.
