<h2>Monitoring the Earth's Dynamic Magnetic Field</h2>

<p>
  For centuries, the compass has been used for orientation and
  navigation, with the north-seeking tendency of its magnetized
  needle responding to Earth's magnetic field.  The main part of
  the field is complicated in shape and it changes over time.  As a
  result, magnetic maps and charts need to be updated every few years,
  an on-going project that requires the collection of magnetic data
  from satellites, dedicated surveys, and permanent observatories
  located around the world. In recent years, monitoring of the Earth's
  magnetic field has become important for mitigating the impacts of
  space weather. Magnetic storms, or periods of time when the field is
  unusually active, are caused by the dynamic interaction of the
  Earth's magnetic field with the Sun. It is during magnetic storms
  that beautiful auroral lights can be seen at high latitudes. But
  magnetic storms can also adversely affect the infrastructure and
  activities of our modern, technology based society. Large storms
  can cause the loss of radio communication, reduce the accuracy of
  global-positioning systems, damage satellite electronics and affect
  satellite operations, enhance radiation levels for astronauts and
  high-altitude pilots, increase pipeline corrosion, and induce
  voltage surges in electric power grids, causing blackouts.
  Consequently, the science of geomagnetism is more important today
  than at any point in the discipline's long and colorful history.

  The mission of the U.S. Geological Survey's Geomagnetism Program is to
  monitor the Earth's magnetic field. Using ground-based observatories, the
  Program provides continuous records of magnetic field variations covering
  long timescales; disseminates magnetic data to various governmental,
  academic, and private institutions; and conducts research into the nature
  of geomagnetic variations for purposes of scientific understanding and
  hazard mitigation. The Program is an integral part of the U.S.
  Government's National Space Weather Program (NSWP), which also includes
  programs in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the
  Department of Defense (DOD), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
  Administration (NOAA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The NSWP
  works to provide timely, accurate, and reliable space weather warnings,
  observations, specifications, and forecasts, and its work is important for
  the U.S. economy and national security.

<p>
  USGS data are used to model and map the global magnetic field, which
  requires cooperation among the international community of geomagnetism
  and various satellite programs. The USGS Geomagnetism Program's work with
  foreign national geomagnetism programs is coordinated through Intermagnet,
  a worldwide consortium of observatory programs, and the International
  Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy. Regionally, USGS data are used
  to support aeromagnetic surveys and directional drilling programs for the
  oil and gas extraction industry. USGS data also are used by the pipeline
  and electrical power grid industries, as well as for academic studies
  across a broad range of geophysical sciences.

<h2>A Long History of Service</h2>

<p>
  Over the course of its existence, the USGS Geomagnetism Program has
  evolved in response to changing National needs and organizational changes
  within various Federal agencies. The Program traces its origins back to
  1807 when Congress authorized coastal surveys, including geomagnetic
  surveys, under the Treasury Department. In the 19th century, magnetic
  stations were established to help with the development of magnetic maps
  for the United States and Territories. With the purchase of Alaska,
  coastal surveys became increasingly important, and so in 1878 the Coast
  and Geodetic Survey (CGS) was established, with a separate Division of
  Terrestrial Magnetism established in 1899. The first permanent CGS
  geomagnetic observatory was established in 1900, and because of the
  co-location of seismometers on some observatory sites, a fruitful
  collaboration between Geomagnetism and Seismology began. In 1903, the CGS
  was transferred to the newly established Department of Commerce and
  became part of NOAA when that agency was formed in 1970. Soon thereafter,
  both the Geomagnetism and Seismology Programs in CGS were transferred to
  the USGS.

<h2>The Program Today</h2>

<p>
  Geomagnetism is headquartered with the USGS Geologic Hazards Team in
  Golden, Colorado, which also includes staff supported by the Earthquake
  Hazards and Landslide Hazards Programs. The engineers and technicians of
  the Geomagnetism Program are responsible for the collection,
  transportation, and dissemination of data from 14 observatories in real
  time, and the program also has significant data-processing and management
  capabilities. Accurate measurements are made automatically at each
  observatory every second. By necessity, everything associated with
  acquiring and handling the data is technologically elaborate, and the
  system's many finely tuned components need to be carefully operated
  and synchronized.
</p>

<h2>Looking to the Future</h2>

<p>
  In response to the rapidly evolving science of geomagnetism, and the ever
  more stringent demands of the scientific community, Program staff are
  constantly upgrading and modernizing the observatory network. In the
  future, the Geomagnetism Program will monitor the magnetic field at
  higher frequencies and, when needed, gradually expand the observatory
  network in collaboration with allied agencies. Program staff are
  undertaking new scientific research and product development focused on
  characterizing the complicated behavior of the Earth's magnetic field in
  space and time, especially during magnetic storms.
